These fell energies infuse the corpse and the webbings it was caught in, trapping the soul within. The result of this confluence is a spiteful creature that seeks to inflict its fate upon others, lashing out at the living. Named fell husks for their drained appearance, these undead typically linger in the areas of their death, even occasionally making home along the spider that brought about their death. A fell husk is typically the height of whatever humanoid it was born from though weighs significantly less as it has been drained of most of its bodily fluids.</p>\n<p>Fell husks emulate their killers in their tactics and movements, often skittering along high perches such as tall trees and cave ceilings before trapping the victims in webs. They try to catch stragglers when confronted with groups, trapping them and dragging them away before their allies even notice. While most fell husks are unable to manage anything more than simplistic ambush tactics, some are able to devise traps with their webbing that they will use to disable and separate their victims. Occasionally, fell husks are known to serve spider-like creatures or to have swarms of spiders crawling in their webs. These fell husks are typically immune to the damage that their resident swarm deals.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Although fell husks prefer making use of their unnatural powers, many still carry the gear that they wielded in life. Additionally, weapons and other treasures often get caught in their webbing and remain there.

Once a barrel is filled, packed with anywhere from three to seven corpses, it is sealed and then dumped in the harbor. Over time, the souls and bodies degrade, merging together in a horrid mass of flesh that is driven only by their desire for revenge.
